          I am a full stack web developer with a strong knack for creative problem
        solving and a constant desire to innovate simple solutions to complex
        problems. I have a background in motion graphics, which I leverage to
        make the most visually pleasing user experience possible. I’m earning a
        certificate in Full Stack Development from the University of Central
        Florida, where I have learned how to be a dynamic and effective member
        (or leader) of a development team. A scholar of responsive web design, I
        always have my ear to the ground for the newest, most cutting edge
        developments in the world of web development. I hope to use these skills
        to create an unforgettable user experience everywhere that my code goes.
